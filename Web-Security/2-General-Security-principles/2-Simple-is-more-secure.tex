Increase security 
  Use clearly named function and variables 
  Write code comments 
  prefer built-in functions
  remove cruft 
    Cruft is anything that's left over, redundant, or getting in the way. 
    It may be legacy code, or features that are no longer needed.
  Disabled unused feature 
  break up long sections of code  into smaller functions
  Refactoring 
    Give each function a specific purpose.
    Don't let it do more than one thing, and give it a name that makes that purpose clear. 

  Don't repeat yourself
  Simple is always more secure
