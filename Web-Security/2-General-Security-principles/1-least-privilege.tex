limiting access 

"Every program and Every privileged user of the system should should operate using the least
amount of privilege necessary to complete the job" 

The principle of least privilege 
  means giving a user account only those privileges which are
  essential to that user's work, and nothing more.

  Control access to system and resources 
  Grant as little access as possible 
  Expire access as soon as it's no longer needed 
  limits vulnerability, reduces damages
